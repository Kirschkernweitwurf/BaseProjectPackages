## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.2] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- `FpsSamplerTests` and `SceneLoaderTests`. Between them and the version file, that is every
  piece of this package that can be wrong without anyone noticing on screen.
- `ConfirmationRequestTests`, covering what an omitted button label falls back to.
- An edit mode test assembly, `Base.UIPackage.Tests`, covering the version file. Together with the
  billboard play tests, that is the logic in this package that can be wrong without anyone noticing.

### Changed

- Assembly references are GUIDs rather than names, matching the ones already written that way.
  A GUID reference survives an assembly being renamed; a name reference silently stops
  resolving. Unity's own assemblies stay named, since they have no GUID to point at.
- The frame rate smoothing and the update throttle moved out of `FpsCounter` into
  `FpsSampler`. Both sat inside `Update` reading `Time.unscaledDeltaTime`, so neither could be
  driven by a test. `FpsCounter` keeps the component and the label.
- The button label fallback moved out of `ConfirmationMenu` onto `ConfirmationRequest`. Reading an
  empty label as "use the default" is a decision the request makes, and behind the menu it could
  only be reached by standing up a live menu with buttons and text to draw it with.
- The version file reading, counting and formatting moved out of `BuildVersion` into
  `BuildVersionFile`. All three sat behind a MonoBehaviour pointed at one fixed path, which is why
  none of them could be covered. `BuildVersion` keeps the component and the path.
- Depends on `Base.CorePackage.CameraUtility` instead of `Base.CorePackage`. The only thing this
  package took from that assembly was the `CameraProvider`, and the reference dragged five unrelated
  Core systems along with it. Nothing here changes; a change to any of those five stops recompiling
  this package.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- References `Base.CorePackage.MenuManaging` and `Base.CorePackage.SceneManagement` alongside
  `Base.CorePackage`, which it still needs for `CameraProvider`. Those two systems moved into
  assemblies of their own in the Core split.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- `documentationUrl` and `changelogUrl` in `package.json`, so the Package Manager window
  links straight to the README and to this file.
- The package's first test assembly, in play mode, covering `Billboard`.
