## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.8] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Team documentation in `Documentation~`, moved over from the old wiki and checked against the code.
  `documentationUrl` now points at it.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- The README lists `Base Audio` and `Base Core Debug` as requirements. The audio containers
  and the cheat and log console prefabs in this package reference components that moved out of
  Core, so installing without them leaves those prefabs with missing scripts.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- `documentationUrl` and `changelogUrl` in `package.json`, so the Package Manager window
  links straight to the README and to this file.
