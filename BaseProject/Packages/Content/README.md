# Base Content

Every prefab and configured asset the other Base packages are wired together with. This package holds no code at all.

**Team docs:** how to use everything in the editor is in [`Documentation~/index.md`](Documentation~/index.md). In Unity, open `Help > Base Packages Documentation`.

It exists because composition and code pull in opposite directions: a prefab carrying an `AudioManager`, a `MenuManager` and a save button needs three packages installed, while each of those packages on its own should install into an empty project and compile. Keeping the wiring here is what lets that stay true.

## Requirements

- Unity `6000.3` or newer
- `Base.ControllerSupportPackage`, `Base.SaveSystemPackage`, `Base.SettingsPackage` and
  `Base.UiPackage`, plus `Base Audio` and `Base Core Debug` for the audio containers
  and the console prefabs

Those pull in Core, Services, Tweening, Attributes and Utility in turn. Install through the Git Package Manager rather than by pasting the Git URL: the prefabs here reference components from the other Base packages, so installing this one on its own leaves them with missing scripts.

## Managers and bootstrap

**Bootstrapper** instantiates the three manager prefabs below. It sits in a `Resources` folder so it can be pulled into a scene or a build without a direct reference.

- **PersistentManagers** is instantiated once per session and survives scene loads. It carries the services that outlive a scene.
- **SceneManagers** is instantiated for every scene.
- **GameplayManagers** is instantiated only while one of the scenes configured on the `Bootstrapper` is loaded.

## UI prefabs

**PersistentCanvas**, **GameplayOverlayCanvas** and **GameplayWorldCanvas** are the screen space and world space canvas roots. **ConfirmationMenu** backs the awaitable confirmation dialog, **LoadingScreen** is shown by the `SceneLoadingManager` while a scene loads, and **Tooltip** is the view the `TooltipService` positions.

**DebugMenu** hosts the **CheatConsole** and the **LogConsole**, with **Suggestion** as the row the cheat console builds its autocomplete from. **BasicTextButton** and **BasicImageButton** are the starting points for menu buttons, with the click and hover audio containers already assigned. **FpsText (TMP)** is the frames per second readout.

## Audio

The four pooled source prefabs (2D, 3D, Music and UI) are what the `AudioManager` plays through, one per `EAudioType`, each routed to its own group on the **AudioMixer**. `AudioVolumeSetting` from the Settings package pushes the player's volume into that mixer's exposed parameters.

The UI click and hover clips are samples meant to be replaced. What the prefabs reference are the **AUC_Click** and **AUC_Hover** audio containers, so swapping the clips inside them keeps every prefab wired.

## Menu identifiers

Identifier assets for the confirmation menu, loading screen, debug menu, cheat console, log console, main menu, pause menu and credits menu. Menus are resolved by identifier rather than by name, so an identifier has to exist before a menu can be opened.
