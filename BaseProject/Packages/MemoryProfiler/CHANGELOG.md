## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.7]
### Changed

- Assembly references are GUIDs rather than names, matching the ones already written that way.
  A GUID reference survives an assembly being renamed; a name reference silently stops
  resolving. Unity's own assemblies stay named, since they have no GUID to point at.

 - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Four more cases on the config: the default interval, the flags that decide whether a snapshot
  holds anything at all, the absence of a baked path on a fresh asset, and an interval above the
  floor surviving an edit. The clamp was only covered downwards before.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- References `Base.CorePackage.SceneManagement` rather than `Base.CorePackage`, which is where
  scene loading lives after the Core split. The package turned out never to have used anything
  else in Core, so the old reference is gone rather than kept alongside.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- `documentationUrl` and `changelogUrl` in `package.json`, so the Package Manager window
  links straight to the README and to this file.
- The package's first test assembly, in edit mode, covering the config defaults and the
  interval clamp.
- Tests for `MemoryProfilerRunner.ResolveStorageDirectory`, covering relative paths resolving
  against the project folder, absolute paths being left alone, and the fallbacks.
