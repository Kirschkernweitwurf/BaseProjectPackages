    /// Overriding <c>Editor.OnHeaderGUI</c> does not work here. Unity only calls it for the editor that
    /// owns the whole inspector, which is the GameObject or the asset. The title bar of each component
    /// is drawn by the inspector itself, and the only extension point it offers is the internal list
    /// behind <c>[EditorHeaderItem]</c>. Appending to that list through reflection is what every tool
    /// that puts controls in a component header ends up doing.
    /// <para>
    /// Unity builds the list lazily, the first time any header is drawn, and skips rebuilding it once it
    /// exists. Injecting before that point would replace it and take Unity's own header items with it,
    /// so this waits for the list to appear instead of forcing it into being. If the field is gone
    /// because the internal API changed, the hook quietly gives up and header controls stop appearing;
    /// nothing else in the package depends on it.
