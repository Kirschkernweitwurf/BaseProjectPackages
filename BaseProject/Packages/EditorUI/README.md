# Base Editor UI

The shared look of the Base editor windows. Editor only, no dependencies, so any tool assembly can reference it without dragging anything else in.

Every color, corner radius, row height and gap comes from a **theme** the project owns. Assign one under `Project Settings > Base Tools > Editor UI Theme`, drag a slider, and every open Base window redraws with it. With no theme assigned the package draws with its built-in look, which is exactly what it drew with before themes existed.

What does **not** live here is anything one window alone understands. A badge color for "group has no menu", a chip color for "creates an asset", the width of one particular button: those stay in the window's own style class. This package is the shared floor, not a replacement for per-window styling.

## Requirements

- Unity `6000.3` or newer
- No dependencies, Base or otherwise
- One assembly: `Base.EditorUIPackage.Editor`, Editor platform only

## One namespace for the whole package

Every type here declares `Base.EditorUIPackage.Editor`, including the ones under `Theme` and `Uss`. Same
reason as the Attributes package: a window pulling in a palette, some metrics, a row helper and a
style set should need one using line, not four. The folders are marked as non-namespace-providers
(Rider: **folder > Properties > Namespace provider: off**), so a folder-to-namespace scan reporting
these is reporting the convention.

## Theming

A theme is a `ScriptableObject` in your project, so it can be version controlled, shared and switched. Which one is active is stored in `ProjectSettings/BaseEditorTheme.asset` by GUID, so the choice travels with the project rather than with the machine and survives the asset being renamed or moved.

1. Open `Project Settings > Base Tools > Editor UI Theme`
2. Hit **Create Theme Asset** and pick a place for it
3. Edit anything under **Dark Skin Colors**, **Light Skin Colors**, **Layout** or **List Windows**

The preview at the top of the page is a real list window drawn from the real styles, so what you see there is what the Service Locator, Event Bus, Todo and attribute windows will look like. **Use Built-in Look** puts the project back on the defaults without deleting the asset, and **Reset To Built-in Look** puts the asset itself back.

Each of the two editor skins carries its own finished colors rather than a shared color plus an opacity, so changing one skin never moves the other. What used to be written as a neutral overlay is simply white or black at a low opacity in the dark and light sets.

### Presets

Eight looks to start from, named after the pigment or stone each one is built on, shown as two rows
of four under the preview.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Slate** | The Base look | Blue-grey stone, near-neutral walls under a blue accent |
| **Onyx** | Most legible | Black on white, squarer corners and heavier hairlines |
| **Graphite** | No color at all | Walls and text achromatic, states set apart by lightness |
| **Verdigris** | Red-green safe | The patina on copper. Teal, gold and violet instead of green, amber and red |
| **Cobalt** | Blue and orange | The pair that survives every deficiency, including the blue-yellow loss most people acquire with age |
| **Quartz** | Pink and soft | Rose quartz, low glare, for a long session |
| **Amber** | Candlelight | The darkest of the eight, warm walls, warm off-white text, soft corners |
| **Malachite** | Quiet | Green stone, low saturation, calmer than the scene view beside it |

A preset is not just an accent color. Four things vary: how much hue is in the walls, from none at
all in Graphite to a quarter in Cobalt and Amber; how dark those walls are, with Amber the darkest by
a clear step; how warm the text is, since a warm theme with grey text does not read as warm; and how
it is built, with Onyx squaring its corners and thickening its hairlines while Amber softens both.

Every color is fitted to a contrast target rather than picked by eye, measured against both WCAG 2
and APCA. Every preset reaches Lc 90 on body text and Lc 60 on secondary text and status colors, and
Onyx reaches Lc 100 and Lc 75.

The three status colors are also staggered in lightness rather than all fitted to one target. Three
colors at the same contrast level are the same brightness by construction, so the moment hue is lost
they collapse into one. That is a greyscale screenshot, a projector with the color turned down, or a
reader who sees no color at all.

### How a change reaches a window

`EditorThemeProvider` caches the resolved look, because a list window reads several values per row per repaint. Changing anything calls `NotifyChanged`, which drops the cache, raises `Revision` by one and repaints every view.

A style cache notices by comparing the revision it built with. `EditorStyleSet` and `EditorSkinWatch` both do this already, so a window that uses either gets theme support with no code of its own:

```csharp
internal sealed class MyWindowStyles : EditorStyleSet
{
    internal GUIStyle Row { get; private set; }

    protected override void Build()
    {
        Row = EditorStyleUtility.PinTextColor(new GUIStyle(EditorStyles.label), EditorPalette.Text);
    }
}
```

Caches poll the revision rather than subscribing to an event on purpose. A static event outlives play mode while Domain Reload is off, and would keep handing frames to windows that closed long ago. An integer cannot.

A static style cache cannot inherit `EditorStyleSet`, so it holds an `EditorSkinWatch` instead:

```csharp
private static readonly EditorSkinWatch Watch = new();

private static void EnsureBuilt()
{
    if (!Watch.IsStale)
        return;

    // build the styles

    Watch.MarkFresh();
}
```

Asking and answering are two calls rather than one because rebuilding can fail. Reading an editor style while a dropdown owns the GUI throws, and a cache that marked itself fresh before that happened would stay half built for the rest of the session.

### Why these are properties and not constants

`EditorMetrics` and `EditorTableStyles` expose sizes as static properties. A constant is copied into every assembly that reads it at compile time, so a themed value would stay baked into whatever it happened to be when that assembly was last built. Nothing in a Base package may declare `const float X = EditorMetrics.Y;` for the same reason.

## The parts worth knowing

`EditorPalette` exposes `Accent`, `AccentText`, `Text`, `DimText`, `Background`, `Field`, `Card`, `Border`, `Secondary`, `SecondaryText`, `Stripe`, `Hover`, `Selection`, `SelectionFill`, `Separator`, `Divider`, `KeyCap`, `Focus`, `Warning`, `Success` and `Danger`, all resolved for the active skin and theme. Three building blocks sit underneath, for the colors a window defines itself: `Pick(pro, personal)` returns the value for the current skin, `Tint(proAlpha, personalAlpha)` returns a neutral overlay that lightens on the dark skin and darkens on the light one, and `WithAlpha(color, alpha)` fades a color, which is how a badge or a row tint is built.

`EditorTableStyles` is the whole look of a list window, and the thing a new list window should start from rather than copy. Subclass it and add only what is yours:

```csharp
internal sealed class MyListStyles : EditorTableStyles
{
    internal const float MinWindowWidth = 660f;

    internal static Color MyStateBadgeColor => BadgeFill(EditorPalette.Focus);
}
```

Its static members are reachable through the subclass name, so `MyListStyles.RowInset` and `MyListStyles.EmptyIconRect(area)` work without redeclaring anything. `BadgeFill` mixes any color at the theme's badge opacity, for a state the shared fills have no name for.

`EditorStyleUtility.PinTextColor` pins a style's text color across normal, hover, active and focused. Without it, plain labels light up like buttons when the mouse passes over them. `BuildFilledButton` draws the rounded accent or muted button, generating its three backgrounds into the caller's texture cache. `Shade` brightens on hover and darkens on press, `MutedTextColor` takes the muted gray from the skin rather than guessing it, and `UniformPadding` and `HorizontalPadding` build `RectOffset` values.

`EditorTextureCache` textures are hidden and not saved, so the owner has to `Release` them. A rounded texture is a `2 * radius + 1` square whose single center pixel stretches, so corners keep their true size at any target rectangle. Set the style's `border` to the same radius.

`EditorFonts.Monospaced()` is created once per domain and deliberately never destroyed: destroying it left every `GUIStyle` built from it pointing at nothing, which Unity reports as a deleted invalid font reference on the next reload.

## Who uses it

The Attributes, Controller Support, Core, Services and Tools packages all build their windows on this. The Base Package Installer deliberately does not: it is the tool that installs this package, so in a fresh project it has to compile before any Base package exists.
