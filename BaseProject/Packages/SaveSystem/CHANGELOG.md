## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.3]
### Changed

- Assembly references are GUIDs rather than names, matching the ones already written that way.
  A GUID reference survives an assembly being renamed; a name reference silently stops
  resolving. Unity's own assemblies stay named, since they have no GUID to point at.

 - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Edit mode tests build their objects outside any scene. They used to be created in whatever scene
  happened to be open, so every run put them in it and a run that never reached its teardown left
  them there to be saved with it. They go through `EditorUtility.CreateGameObjectWithHideFlags` now,
  which never puts them in a scene at all, so they cannot show up in the hierarchy or be saved
  however the run ends.
- Stray blank line runs in `SavableRegistryTests` and `SaveMigrationChainTests`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- `SaveCodec` now throws `ArgumentNullException` for a null read encryptor list instead of
  failing later with a `NullReferenceException`, matching how its other two arguments behave.

### Added

- `documentationUrl` and `changelogUrl` in `package.json`, so the Package Manager window
  links straight to the README and to this file.
- Tests for the autosave setting keys, including that the three settings do not share one.

### Changed

- The test assembly references `Base.SaveSystemPackage.Settings`, whose three files could not
  be named by any test before.
