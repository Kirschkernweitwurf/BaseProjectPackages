# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this package uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.4] - 2026-09-07

### Removed

- Three serialized field names nothing reads, not even the tests they were written for: the two
  randomized pitch bounds on the manager and the scene load clearing flag on the pool. The rest are
  read by the play tests and stay.

## [1.1.2]
### Changed

- Assembly references are GUIDs rather than names, matching the ones already written that way.
  A GUID reference survives an assembly being renamed; a name reference silently stops
  resolving. Unity's own assemblies stay named, since they have no GUID to point at.

 - 2026-09-06

### Added

- An edit mode test assembly, `Base.AudioPackage.Tests`, covering `ActiveSounds`, `AudioContainer`,
  `AudioFader`, `AudioPool` and `AudioSourceConfigurator`.
- A play mode test assembly, `Base.AudioPackage.PlayTests`, covering `AudioManager` and
  `AudioPoolManager`. Both build their state in `Awake` and both release sources over frames, so
  neither is reachable from edit mode. Between the two assemblies this is the first coverage the
  package has had.
- `InternalsVisibleTo` for both test assemblies, so the tracking table, the pool wrapper and the
  source configurator stay internal instead of being widened to be reachable.
- Constants on `AudioManager` and `AudioPoolManager` naming their serialized fields, so a test can
  wire a manager before it is switched on without spelling the field names out.

### Fixed

- Edit mode tests build their objects outside any scene. They used to be created in whatever scene
  happened to be open, so every run put them in it and a run that never reached its teardown left
  them there to be saved with it. They go through `EditorUtility.CreateGameObjectWithHideFlags` now,
  which never puts them in a scene at all, so they cannot show up in the hierarchy or be saved
  however the run ends.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Split out of `Base Core`, where it shared a package with fifteen systems it has nothing to do
  with. It imports nothing from Core, which is why it carries no `Core` in its name and why a
  project can install it without installing Core at all.
- The namespaces are `Base.AudioPackage`, `Base.AudioPackage.OnEvent`, `Base.AudioPackage.Pool`
  and `Base.AudioPackage.Editor`, replacing the `Base.CorePackage.Audio` ones they had while the
  code lived in Core.
